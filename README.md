# Sign Language Detection System ðŸ––
This project presents a sign language detection system capable of translating basic signs like "hello" and "thank you" in real-time on a web browser. The system leverages the power of MediaPipe for extracting face and hand features and utilizes a Transformer-based model built with TensorFlow.js for accurate sign recognition.

## Features:
Real-time sign language detection
Recognition of basic signs like "hello" and "thank you"
Web-based application for easy access
Built with TensorFlow.js for efficient and portable deployment
Leverages MediaPipe for accurate feature extraction

## Technologies:

Frontend: TensorFlow.js
Backend: TensorFlow
Face and Hand Detection: MediaPipe
Image Processing: OpenCV
Math: NumPy

## Dataset:

A custom dataset consisting of videos I recorded demonstrating different signs was collected for model training.

## Application:
